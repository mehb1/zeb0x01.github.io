      <strong>>>> Security Report: </strong> Private Feed Through a Public Read Access Token
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>>>> Reported: </strong> January 28, 2022 10:18pm +0530 
      <p>
      <strong>>>> Description:</strong> During our security testing of the application
      hubs.mozilla.com as part of Mozilla's bug bounty program, we identified a
      vulnerability related to the access control mechanism in GitHub's API.
      Specifically, we were able to access private feed data through a public
      read access token. With this token, we were able to fetch the API endpoint
      (https://api.github.com/feeds) and receive feeds of both private user and
      organization data. To reproduce this issue, we followed these steps: 1.
      Created a public access token with no specific permissions. 2. Sent a curl
      request with the token to the GitHub API endpoint: curl
      https://api.github.com/feeds -H "Authorization: token ghp_{your_token}".
      3. Received a JSON response containing 2-3 URLs, depending on the number
      of organizations the user belongs to. 4. The URLs provided access to
      private data, including internal pull requests, which was not intended.
      This bypass of OAuth permissions represents a significant security risk
      for GitHub users and their organizations, as private data could be
      accessed without proper authorization. The feeds data exposed internal
      pull request data of the organizations the user belonged to. We
      immediately reported this vulnerability to GitHub's security team and
      worked with them to remediate the issue. We were awarded a bounty for our
      responsible disclosure of this vulnerability.

      As always, we remain committed to identifying and reporting
      vulnerabilities in software and web applications to help keep our clients'
      data safe and secure.
